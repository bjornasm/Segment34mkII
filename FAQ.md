# Segment34 MkII - Frequently asked Questions

## How do I change the settings? Where are the settings?
The settings is only available through the Garmin Connect IQ app. Go to [the page for the watch face](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/aa85d03d-ab89-4e06-b8c6-71a014198593) and look for the big blue Settings button. You can also find it if you go to Device -> My Watch Faces -> Segment34 MkII.

The settings can not be changed on the watch itself.

## Do I need to buy you a coffee to unlock features of the watch face?
**No, everything is included for free**. Donating money / buying coffee through ko-fi does not unlock anything as there is nothing to unlock, everything is already included. You are however very welcome to support me anyway if you like the watch face: [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/M4M51A1RGV)
